# MyGitProject
#
# This is a simple project consisting of Angular JS, Spring Boot and MySQL, showing some of my skills and coding style.
#
# The mainPage.html combines many small pages, like nba.html and stock.html
# Using the Angular JS directives to include small pages to develop them without modifying the mainPage.
# To get the datas I try to call some RESTful API like www.data.nba.net.
#
# Things to do.
# - Bootstrap.
# - Stock Page.
# - Chart.js.
